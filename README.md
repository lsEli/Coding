### Now

- Currently I'm working on the React.js folder

1. Front-end folder update (Javascript)
2. Back-end folder update (Java basics)
3. Back-end folder update (C#)
4. Probably I'm going to complement with a database project in Oracle and PostgreSQL, which it is going to help with the back-end examples.

Check the Database repository in a few days.
