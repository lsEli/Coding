### Now

- Currently I'm working on Microservices.

### What's next

- Front-end folder update.

### What's in mind

1. Front-end folder update (Javascript).
2. Back-end folder update (Java basics).
3. Back-end folder update (C#).
4. Probably I'm going to complement with a database project in Oracle and PostgreSQL, which it is going to help with the back-end examples.

Check the Database repository in a few days.
