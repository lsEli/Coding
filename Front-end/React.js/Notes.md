# Notes

## Components

A React component is a reusable building block in React, which encapsulates the logic, structure, and behavior of a part of a user interface.

## Functional Components/Stateless Components

A functional component in React is a JavaScript function that returns JSX, representing the structure and content of the component. Functional components are simpler and more concise compared to class components.

## Class Components/Stateful Components

A class component in React is a JavaScript class that extends the React.Component class. It allows you to define a component's behavior, state, and lifecycle methods.

## Hooks

Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Before the introduction of hooks, state and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. Hooks provide a way to write reusable and more concise code in functional components.

## JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. It is a syntax extension used by React to define the structure and content of components. JSX provides a concise and familiar way to describe the structure of user interfaces. It allows you to write HTML-like elements, include JavaScript expressions, and use component-based composition.

## Props

Props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They are a fundamental concept in React that enable component composition and reusability.

## State

In React, state is an object that represents the internal data of a component. It allows a component to manage and store data that can change over time. State is used to create dynamic and interactive components by enabling them to update and re-render based on changes in the data.

### setState()

In React, `setState()` is a method provided by the Component class that allows you to update the state of a component. It is used to modify the data stored in the state object and triggers a re-render of the component.
